Traditional methods of infectious disease research using animal models provide limited information about disease progression until the study's endpoint, when investigators can analyze tissues from those animals. Imaging studies allow longitudinal studies of the same animal during the course of infection.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919164125.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"PET imaging tracks Zika virus infection, disease progression in mouse model","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919164125.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"PET imaging tracks Zika virus infection, disease progression in mouse model","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170919164125-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919160353.htm","published":1505851433,"updated":1505851433,"title":"What motivates men to donate sperm online?
