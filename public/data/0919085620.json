When light is stored in ring-shaped or spherical active resonators, the waves superimpose in such a way that it can result in laser light. Investigators now report a new type of dye-doped WGM micro-laser that produces light with tunable wavelengths.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919160340.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Tiny lasers from a gallery of whispers","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919160340.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Tiny lasers from a gallery of whispers","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170919160340-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919160228.htm","published":1505851348,"updated":1505851348,"title":"Security cameras vulnerable to attacks using infrared light","summary":"Researchers have demonstrated that security cameras infected with malware can receive covert signals and leak sensitive information from the very same surveillance devices used to protect facilities.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919160228.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Security cameras vulnerable to attacks using infrared light","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919160228.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919160206.htm","published":1505851326,"updated":1505851326,"title":"Emerging disease further jeopardizes North American frogs","summary":"A deadly amphibian disease called severe Perkinsea infections, or SPI, is the cause of many large-scale frog die-offs in the United States, according to a new study.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919160206.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Emerging disease further jeopardizes North American frogs","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919160206.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Emerging disease further jeopardizes North American frogs","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170919160206-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919160152.htm","published":1505851312,"updated":1505851312,"title":"End-of-summer Arctic sea ice extent is eighth lowest on record","summary":"Arctic sea ice appeared to have reached its yearly lowest extent on Sept. 13, scientists have reported.
