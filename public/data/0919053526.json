Now scientists are finding new details on how disruption of this timing may contribute to male infertility or congenital illness. Researchers are identifying the key molecular and genetic switch that activates production of healthy male sperm -- but only when the time is right.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919110600.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Key regulator of male fertility identifed","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919110600.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919110522.htm","published":1505833522,"updated":1505833522,"title":"Nonlinear physics bridges thoughts to sounds in birdsong","summary":"The beautiful sound of birdsongs emerging from the trees is a wonderful example of how much nature can still teach us, even as much about their origins are still mysterious to us. About 40 percent of bird species learn to vocalize when they are exposed to a tutor, a behavior of interest to many neurologists and neurobiologists. The other 60 percent can vocalize instinctually in isolation. The variety across species, and the relationship between the nervous system and biomechanics makes birdsong production a complex process to unravel and understand.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919110522.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Nonlinear physics bridges thoughts to sounds in birdsong","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919110522.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"}]}
