By identifying these mechanisms, the scientists discovered that therapeutic benefits for patients could derive from a one-two punch of a drug holiday of MAPK inhibitors followed by a class of drugs called DNA repair inhibitors.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918232351.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Treatment-resistant melanoma may be vulnerable to a drug holiday, study finds","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918232351.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Treatment-resistant melanoma may be vulnerable to a drug holiday, study finds","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170918232351-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918232349.htm","published":1505791429,"updated":1505791429,"title":"Catching a diversity of fish species — instead of specializing — means more stable income for fishers","summary":"A team of scientists analyzed nearly 30 years of revenue and permitting records for individuals fishing in Alaskan waters and tracked how their fishing choices, in terms of permits purchased and species caught, influenced their year-to-year income volatility.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918232349.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Catching a diversity of fish species — instead of specializing — means more stable income for fishers","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918232349.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918232247.htm","published":1505791367,"updated":1505791367,"title":"The sublime challenge of jet noise","summary":"A scientists is using ALCF resources to create high fidelity simulations of jet turbulence to determine how and where noise is produced.

However, the bandwidth of these electronic computers is limited by the signal delay of time constants important to electronic logic operations. In an attempt to mitigate these problems, scientists have considered the development of an optical digital computer, and one team has gone so far as to demonstrate the optical and electrical bistability for switching in a single transistor.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918232211.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Optical, electrical bistability study sheds light on next-gen high speed data transfer","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918232211.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"}]}
