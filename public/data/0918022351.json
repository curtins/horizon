Higher exposure to secondary particles and ozone can be traced back to excess NOx emissions from diesel cars, vans and light commercial vehicles. With the EU's vehicle emission limits achieved on the road about 5,000 premature deaths could be avoided annually. If diesel cars emitted as little NOx as petrol cars, about 7,500 premature deaths could be avoided annually.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918093337.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"5,000 deaths annually from Diesel-gate in Europe","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918093337.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"5,000 deaths annually from Diesel-gate in Europe","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170918093337-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918092858.htm","published":1505741338,"updated":1505741338,"title":"Studies of ‘Crater Capital' in the Baltics show impactful history","summary":"Studies of craters in the Baltics (Estonia) are giving insights into the many impacts that have peppered the Earth over its long history.

Now, a study of terrestrial dust devils has shown that around two thirds of the fine particles lifted by these vortices can remain suspended in the atmosphere and be transported around the globe.
