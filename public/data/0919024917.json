The muscle has intrinsic expansion ability and, unlike previous artificial muscles, it does not require an external compressor or high voltage equipment, signaling a breakthrough in the creation of soft robots that can move independently. The new material also has a strain density -- an ability to expand -- that is 15 times larger than natural muscle.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919091000.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"One step closer to lifelike robots","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919091000.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"One step closer to lifelike robots","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170919091000-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"}]}
