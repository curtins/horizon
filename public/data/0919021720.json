They are complicated to extract, difficult to recycle and so rare that several of them have become \"conflict minerals\" which can promote conflicts and oppression. New research shows that there are potential technology-based solutions that can replace many of the metals with carbon nanomaterials, such as graphene.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919091029.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Graphene and other carbon nanomaterials can replace scarce metals","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919091029.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Graphene and other carbon nanomaterials can replace scarce metals","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170919091029-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919091027.htm","published":1505826627,"updated":1505826627,"title":"Overcoming the brain's fortress-like barrier","summary":"Scientists have helped provide a way to better understand how to enable drugs to enter the brain and how cancer cells make it past the blood brain barrier.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919091027.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Overcoming the brain's fortress-like barrier","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919091027.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919091021.htm","published":1505826621,"updated":1505826621,"title":"Changes in teenage parenthood","summary":"The US birth rate hasn't changed for two generations of teenage girls, but other aspects of young parenthood are shifting, especially regarding young fathers.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919091021.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Changes in teenage parenthood","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919091021.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919091005.htm","published":1505826605,"updated":1505826605,"title":"Students' self-concepts of ability in math, reading predict later math, reading attainment","summary":"A new longitudinal study looked at how youths' self-concepts are linked to their actual academic achievement in math and reading from middle childhood to adolescence.
