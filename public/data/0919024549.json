Medical researchers have found a critical target on which to focus for developing a potential Group A Streptococcus vaccine or antibiotic to fight it. By manipulating this target, they hope to either reduce the severity of these infections or clear them up faster.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918163358.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Potential pathway to treat flesh-eating bacteria","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918163358.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"}]}
