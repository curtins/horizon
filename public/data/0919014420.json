A study, conducted during a shape recognition task, shows as more of the shape is hidden, a brain area involved in cognition starts to sends signals to the visual cortex. The findings make the scientists wonder if this communication between different brain areas might be impaired in people with autism or Alzheimer's. Both conditions can cause confusion in cluttered surroundings and problems recognizing objects.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919091019.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"The brain at work: Spotting half-hidden objects","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170919091019.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918222244.htm","published":1505787764,"updated":1505787764,"title":"Parasitic eye infection poses significant threat to UK dogs, warn experts","summary":"A parasitic worm that is becoming increasingly common in Europe poses a significant threat to UK dogs, warn experts in a new report.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918222244.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Parasitic eye infection poses significant threat to UK dogs, warn experts","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918222244.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918163433.htm","published":1505766873,"updated":1505766873,"title":"Analyzing the language of color","summary":"Languages tend to divide the \"warm\" part of the color spectrum into more color words, such as orange, yellow, and red, compared to the \"cooler\" regions, which include blue and green, cognitive scientists have found.

Veterans diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder often are prescribed this type of therapy to cope with anxiety, but little is known about how these programs affect the stress levels in horses. Now, a study has revealed that horses ridden by veterans with PTSD did not have undue physiological stress responses while participating in a therapy program.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918163406.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Horses working in therapeutic riding programs do not experience additional stress","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918163406.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918151707.htm","published":1505762227,"updated":1505762227,"title":"Coatings needed for concentrating solar power","summary":"Next-generation concentrating solar power (CSP) plants require high-temperature fluids, like molten salts, in the range of 550-750 degrees Celsius to store heat and generate electricity. At those high temperatures, however, the molten salts eat away at common alloys used in the heat exchangers, piping, and storage vessels of CSP systems. New research is aimed at mitigating corrosion levels in CSP plants with nickel-based coatings.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918151707.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Coatings needed for concentrating solar power","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918151707.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"}]}
