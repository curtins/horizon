Without these changes, oxygen could have been suppressed in earth's crust forever, so the findings help explain the emergence of life on our planet.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918111851.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Changes in Earth's crust caused oxygen to fill the atmosphere","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918111851.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Changes in Earth's crust caused oxygen to fill the atmosphere","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170918111851-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918111833.htm","published":1505747913,"updated":1505747913,"title":"Dogs' social skills linked to oxytocin sensitivity","summary":"The tendency of dogs to seek contact with their owners is associated with genetic variations in sensitivity for the hormone oxytocin, according to a new study.

Temperature is, in essence, the relative movement between atoms; thus the goal of getting the atoms to have small relative velocities involves freezing them to extremely cold temperatures. A group has now developed new universal method for cooling ions.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918111824.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"An original method of cooling ions could have new and interesting uses","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918111824.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"An original method of cooling ions could have new and interesting uses","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170918111824-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918111817.htm","published":1505747897,"updated":1505747897,"title":"Wireless high-speed data and power transfer integrated","summary":"Researchers have developed a system that can simultaneously deliver watts of power and transmit data at rates high enough to stream video over the same wireless connection.
