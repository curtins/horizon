This plant is important to small and medium farmers who grow the plant without larger irrigation. Pearl millet delivers a good harvest index under drought and heat conditions when rice, maize or wheat already have no grains anymore.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918143045.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"A cereal crop survives heat and drought","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918143045.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"}]}
