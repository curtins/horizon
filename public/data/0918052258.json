Researchers have now shown that the charged particles will actually forgo their 'opposites attract' behavior, called Coulombic ordering, when confined in the tiny pores of a nanomaterial.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918123549.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Just squeeze in -- when spaces are tight, nature loosens its laws","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918123549.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918123544.htm","published":1505752544,"updated":1505752544,"title":"Step towards better 'beyond lithium' batteries","summary":"A step towards new 'beyond lithium' rechargeable batteries with superior performance has been made.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918123544.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Step towards better 'beyond lithium' batteries","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918123544.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918123541.htm","published":1505752541,"updated":1505752541,"title":"Myth Debunked that OCD Is Associated With Superior Intelligence","summary":"Researchers conducted a meta-analysis of all the available literature on IQ in OCD samples versus non-psychiatric controls (98 studies), and found that contrary to the prevailing myth, OCD is not associated with superior IQ, but with normative IQ that is slightly lower compared to control samples. The authors suggested that the small reduction in IQ scores in OCD sufferers may be largely attributed to OCD-related slowness and not to intellectual ability.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918123541.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Myth Debunked that OCD Is Associated With Superior Intelligence","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918123541.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918123539.htm","published":1505752539,"updated":1505752539,"title":"Scientists show molecular basis for ants acting as 'bodyguards' for plants","summary":"Though you might not think of ants as formidable bodyguards, some do an impressive job protecting plants from enemies.

Melanin appears black in individual nanoparticles. But altering spacing of the nanoparticles in the ball affects how the particles scatter light. A thin silica coating on the outside of melanin nanoparticles acts like a bumper, limiting how close the particles can pack together. Varying the diameter of the melanin core and the thickness of the silica shellÂ creates supraballs in a range of colors.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918123532.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Scalable process discovered to produce structural colors inspired by bird feathers","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918123532.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Scalable process discovered to produce structural colors inspired by bird feathers","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170918123532-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170918123526.htm","published":1505752526,"updated":1505752526,"title":"Physicists discover a tri-anion particle with colossal stability","summary":"Chemists have created the most stable tri-anion particle currently known to science.
